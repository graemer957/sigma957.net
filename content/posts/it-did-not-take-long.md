I have owned and operated this domain for over 17 years... and it has only just got a website. Not that long, right? ðŸ˜‰

Truth, or excuse, of the matter, is that not being much of web developer (thinking HTML and CSS), I always figured it would take too long to set up and maintain. I recently came across [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) whilst reading the [1Password Blog](https://blog.1password.com/) and figured it might be just what I was looking for.

Surely enough, it did not take long for me to come across a minimal and responsive blog theme I liked called [Hermit](https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/). Extremely easy to configure and extremely fast to generate my site. Granted, there is not much to it right now, but:

```
                   | EN
+------------------+----+
  Pages            |  9
  Paginator pages  |  0
  Non-page files   |  0
  Static files     | 12
  Processed images |  0
  Aliases          |  0
  Sitemaps         |  1
  Cleaned          |  0

Total in 26 ms
```

...is still impressive in comparison to other static site generators I have looked at in the past!

Naturally, the site is accelerated and protected by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and will go into much more detail about that in future posts.

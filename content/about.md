## Other Interests
I found a real passion for running a number of years ago. Since then have completed numerous 5/10k's, half, full and ultra marathons. More recently I have taken up swimming and cycling as I would like to challenge myself with triathlons. I find the exercise and being outdoors brings balance to my day job ðŸ˜€

## Self Development
I have always had an enthusiasm for learning and pushing myself further. As such I am currently teaching myself, experimenting with and training for my first Ironman

I've created a [Learning](/learning/) page that I plan to keep up-to-date
with resouces I have use to perform deliberate practice.

I have been meaning to create this for a while and occasionally this kind of
subject comes up in conversations with colleagues or friends.

Finally found a little time to get the first cut up ðŸ˜ƒ What do you use?

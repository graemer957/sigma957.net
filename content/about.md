family and I are based in Farnham, UK, where I'm actively leveling up my
[Rust](https://rust-lang.org) knowledge.

## Other Interests

I found a real passion for running a number of years ago. Since then I have
completed numerous 5/10Ks, half marathons, full marathons, and ultra marathons.
More recently I have taken up swimming and cycling as I wanted to challenge
myself with triathlons. I find the exercise and being outdoors brings balance
to my day job 😀

I have over 20 years of experience working in the IT industry. During that time I have spent time as a:

* Systems & Storage Manager / Architect - designing, building, maintaining and managing both physical and virtual infrastructure that provided services to over ten thousand NHS users
* Field Support Engineer - installation and upgrade engineering for virtualised storage and tape library solutions across northern EMEA
* Software Engineer - developing iOS apps, and their backends, since iPhoneOS 3.1.3 in 2010!

I am completely self-taught.

## Current Status
* Working on the next generation of native apps for the fans of [WWE](https://watch.wwe.com/)
* I am based in Farnham, UK

## Technologies / Languages
A brief, consolidated, list of the technologies and languages I have experience with:

* Building Cocoa Touch (iOS SDK) apps and frameworks using Objective-C and Swift, along with distribution via the App Store and/or Test Flight/HockeyApp
* Swift on Server frameworks Vapor and Kitura
* Containerisation technologies - Docker, Rancher and Kubernates

## Other Interests
I found a real passion for running a number of years ago. Since then have completed numerous 5/10k's, half, full and ultra marathons. More recently I have taken up swimming and cycling as I would like to challenge myself with triathlons. I find the exercise and being outdoors brings balance to my day job ðŸ˜€

## Self Development
I have always had an enthusiasm for learning and pushing myself further. As such I am currently teaching myself, experimenting with and training for:

* Serverless Computing with [Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/products/cloudflare-workers/)
* [Go](https://golang.org/) & [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - interested in their performance, concurrency, safety and cross-compilation (READ: WebAssembly)
* My first Ironman

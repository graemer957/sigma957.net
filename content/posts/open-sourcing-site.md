Recently, I have received a few questions about how this site is structured and deployed. It occurred to me that there is no reason why I should not simply open source the whole site for those interested ðŸ˜€

So starting today you can find the project on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/graemer957/sigma957.net) and [GitHub](https://github.com/graemer957/sigma957.net)[^1]. Feel free to have a look around and let me know if you have any further specific questions.

Oh, you may also be interested in the [build pipeline for the site](../build-pipeline-for-site) blog post. I plan to expand this soon to cover the deployment too.

[^1]: I have been primarily using the cloud-based version of GitLab for the last few years, but realise quite a lot of you prefer GitHub.

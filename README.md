# sigma957.net

Personal website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Hermit](https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit/) theme.

## Initial Setup
1. `hugo new site sigma957.net`
2. `git init`
3. Use fork to commit
4. Create project on GitLab and push
5. Switch theme to `Hermit` with `git clone https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git themes/hermit` and then add `theme = "hermit"` to `config.toml`.

## Creating favicons
Picked the infinity symbol from [icons8](https://icons8.com/icon/set/royalty-free-infinity/color) with the following custom colours:
* Dark colour - #494f5c (73, 79, 92)
* Light colour - #c6cddb (198, 205, 219)

Bit of a cheek as they only let you download a 96x96 without paying mega £££, but free is free!

With downloaded icon then used the excellent [realfavicongenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net) site to do the magic. May have tweaked some of the options for background colours and such.

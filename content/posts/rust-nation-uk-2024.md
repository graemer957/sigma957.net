Excited that I will be attending my first ever Rust developer conference - [Rust Nation UK 2024](https://www.rustnationuk.com/) on the 26th, 27th and 28th of March. The schedule is so packed I am struggling to decide on which sessions to attend ðŸ¤“. Hopefully, I will be able to catch up on the others afterwards!

Thanks to the steer from [Jon Gjengset](https://thesquareplanet.com/) in his recent video on [Hardware and software [2024 edition]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmqpzpzdjI8) setup. If you have not checked out his channel I would highly recommend taking a look, especially at his excellent [Crust of Rust](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa&si=GNTUN3FsO1JMbNnJ) series.

If you are going, see you there. Otherwise, I will be sure to share my experiences here.

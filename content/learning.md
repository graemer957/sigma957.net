This page is a collection of resources I have found, or continue to find, useful
in my journey to become a better engineer. One of the reasons I enjoy what I do
is because I like to understand how things work and learning new things. I hope
this never stops!

## Rust

After reading (several times) "The Book", I would recommend the following places
to continue your learning journey:

- [exercism](https://exercism.org) presents coding
challenges and allows you to solve them using (a) a TDD style approach and (b)
in a **lot** of different languages. Further than that, you are able to ask for
mentoring and/or look at community solutions. Both of which I have found invaluable.

    You can find my general strategy and solutions on
    [GitHub](https://github.com/graemer957/exercism) and
    [my profile](https://exercism.org/profiles/graemer957) on exercism.

- [rustlings](https://rustlings.cool/) provides a collection of challenges
covering various aspects of the language. Helps you become more comfortable
with compiler messages. You can find my solutions on
[GitHub](https://github.com/graemer957/rustlings).

- [CodeCrafters](https://app.codecrafters.io/r/brainy-marten-102425) [**NOTE**:
This is my referral link, for which I get 1-week free] challenges you to
reimplement some of the software we use daily - HTTP server, shell, git, etc.

    What I really enjoy about these challenges is they help you learn about the
    innards of real-world software. I take a balanced approach to solving these
    challenges - think like they could go into production, but balance that with
    time spent per step.

    Check out [my profile](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/graemer957) and
    my [GitHub](https://github.com/graemer957) profile for my solutions (each
    challenge has it's own repo).

- [jonhoo](https://www.youtube.com/@jonhoo)'s YouTube channel is a gold mine
of valuable material. I would say this is definitely on the intermediate to
advanced end, but Jon does well to make everything accessible. Of particular note
is his [Crust of Rust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAl-9HwD858&list=PLqbS7AVVErFiWDOAVrPt7aYmnuuOLYvOa) playlist.

## Computer Science

- [Core Dumped](https://www.youtube.com/@CoreDumpped)'s YouTube channel has
some great material on lots of general computer science subjects from threads to
how transistors run code. The presentation style really helps drive these
principals home.

Install Wrangler using `cargo install wrangler`

Follow guide from Cloudflare: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/sites/start-from-existing/

Publish `wrangler publish -e team957`, for some reason this requires the node version installed as well!?

See wrangler environment support: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tooling/wrangler/configuration/environments/

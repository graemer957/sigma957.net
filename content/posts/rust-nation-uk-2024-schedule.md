Another ~month has flown by and [Rust Nation UK 2024](https://www.rustnationuk.com/) is nearly upon us! I figured I should sit down ahead of time and plan my schedule to maximise my learning opportunities.

This was much harder than I would have liked, given the number of fantastic talks available. Am hoping that the speakers will make their material available online later for us all ðŸ¤“ Anyway here goes...

# Tuesday, 26th March 2024

I am attending the "Unlocking the power of Rust: from concurrency to async and beyond" by Ardan Labs.

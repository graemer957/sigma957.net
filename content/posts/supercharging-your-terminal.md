Merry Christmas everyone üéÑüéÖüèª

For today's blog post, I am re-publishing an article I originally wrote for my company blog on 7th May 2017.

In all likelihood, since I started using a Mac, I have been using the stock Terminal with the **Pro** theme. This has mostly suited me well, but there are a handful of things I always thought could be improved.

Inspired by a [blog post](https://medium.com/salesforce-ux/iterm2-with-zsh-shell-5944ee0502ac) and colleague at work who recently showed me their shell, reignited my interested in updating my setup. This article is the result of the steps I used to set up my terminal.

- Install the excellent [iTerm2](http://www.iterm2.com) which brings some nifty features.

- Setup `zsh` as default shell. Snipped from the [setup instructions](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH):
```bash
brew install zsh zsh-completions
echo "/usr/local/bin/zsh" >> /etc/shells
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

- Install [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh#via-curl):
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

- Download and Install [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts):
```bash
git clone git@github.com:powerline/fonts.git
./install.sh
```

- Change font used in iTerm2 to **Roboto Mono Light for Powerline**

- Edited my `~/.zsh` file:
  - Change `ZSH_THEME` from 'robbyrussell' to '[agnoster](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme)'
 - Add `DEFAULT_USER="<your username>"` to stop seeing **user@host**
 - Update the plugins so `plugins=(git git-flow git-extras web-search)`

- Changed colour present in iTerm2 to '[Darkside](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/master/schemes/Darkside.itermcolors)'

Once all this is done, this is what your shell should look like:

You can see the time, current working directory and git status in my prompt. Also, notice the git status showing the current branch `master`, tag `v0.3`, the `‚óè` representing changes and lastly the `?` to signify a new file. Pretty cool, huh?

_Update_: Found this interesting counter [article](https://joshtronic.com/2017/02/12/you-may-not-need-oh-my-zsh/) since posting

_Update 2_: Installing the [Shell Integration](http://iterm2.com/documentation-shell-integration.html) enables extremely handy shortcuts like Cmd+Shift+A to select previous commands output and _Auto Command Completion_

I spend a decent amount of time running, but have always tried to avoid
listening to music or podcasts. Mainly so I can have my wits about me and enjoy
the environment around me. However, it's always felt like a miss when it comes
to listening to podcasts.

A colleague at work recently told me about bone-conducting headphones by a
company called [Shokz](https://uk.shokz.com/). He did warn me that the audio
quality was not great, but great is of course subjective. Having never heard of
them before, of course I did some research and they seemed like they would be worth
a punt. As a bonus they are approved by England Athletics.

As luck, or my wishlist 😉, would have it I was a very lucky boy and was gifted
a version of [Open Run](https://uk.shokz.com/products/openrun) for my birthday
🎉

Then it occurred to me - what could be better than combining two of my favourite
activities?

I have had my ear on the [Rust in Production](https://corrode.dev/podcast/)
podcast for some time, so downloaded every episode in my Spotify client.

Oh boy, have I been impressed. Not only by the audio quality, but the
amazing quality of the podcast itself 🦀

They have had some incredible people on the show talking about some fascinating
subjects. I think the host Matthias Endler, does an amazing job teasing out
details and making the content consumable for a broad audience. My favourites
to date have been:

* [PubNub with Stephen Blum](https://corrode.dev/podcast/s01e02-pubnub/)
* [Tweede Golf with Folkert de Vries](https://corrode.dev/podcast/s01e05-tweede-golf/)
* [AMP with Carter Schultz](https://corrode.dev/podcast/s02e02-amp/)
* [System76 with Jeremy Soller](https://corrode.dev/podcast/s02e07-system76/)
* [Oxide with Steve Klabnik](https://corrode.dev/podcast/s03e03-oxide/)
* [Volvo with Julius Gustavsson](https://corrode.dev/podcast/s03e08-volvo/)

I would **highly** recommend it, and as such, I've added it to my
[Learning](/learning/) page.
